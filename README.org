#+title: Circuits


Code and schematics for circuit examples, scripts and projects.

Most of these were made for the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

* Relation of sketches

  - [[./rfid/README.org][RFID Card Reader]]
  - [[./neopixel_blink/README.org][NeoPixel (WS2812) Blinking RGB LEDs]]
    - [[./neopixel_blink_control/README.org][NeoPixel  Blinking  RGB LEDs,  but  with  a  push button,  extra  blinking
      configuration and web service]]

** Note for Arduino IDE Users

If you want to add support on Arduino IDE, get the JSON link for the boards repository above,
go to Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040. Go to File > Preferences, paste the link on
"Additional Boards Manager URLs". Then you'll want to go to Boards Manager and install
"Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040".

This should  make you  able to write  sketches and upload  them with  ease, plus
monitor the serial port too.
